it's very convenient to have google cloud sdk on your local computer so that you can aceess the vm via terminal directly
For Mac OS: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-macos

follow the instruction to install and config, our default compute zone should be us-east-1-b

Then you can use "gcloud compute ssh [uni]@instance-1" to access the vm


The installation I did today but I don't know whether it's global or not

1. sudo apt install build-essential
2. sudo apt install ocaml
3. sudo apt install git
4. do the git clone thing
5. little trick: run "git config credential.helper store" to store your credentials for github so that every time when you push something, you don't need to re-enter your username and password everytime
